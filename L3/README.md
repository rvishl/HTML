Layout tags are semantic tags.
-> Semantic Tags. (Semantic Element, this is more correct). - They give an idea about what type of content we will have inside it.
-> A non semantic tag will not be able to give any idea about what kind of content we will put in it.

<table> -> Semantic Element.
<div> -> It is a non-semantic element.
<header> / <footer> / <nav> / <section> / <aside> / <article> -> It is a semantic element.
<span> -> non semantic
