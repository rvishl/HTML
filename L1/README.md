What is HTML?
-> It stand for HyperText markup language.
-> Structure of a web page
-> A document designed to be (rendered) displayed.
-> It is a document consisting of various tags.
-> It is a case insensitive language.
-> It allows nesting. (We can have tags inside other tags).

    Hypertext means, the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether.

    Markup language, it is structure something in a specific format. It is used to present or format text syntactically where one type of text can be differentiated from other text. 
    For example: HTML5 uses <h1> </h1> tag to show most important heading and <h6></h6> to show the least important heading. This way, the meaning of the text is differentiated even both the headings are texted.
    -> Formatting the content/structuring the content.
    -> This is used to make the content visually understandable. (Meanwhile being understandable by the machine).

    -> HTML and XML(Extensible Markup Language)
    -> XML is used to store/stucture the network data/ meta data / additional data. (The browser will not be rendering this).
    ->Browser will render (display) HTML files.
    (For now, render means Display).

    -> Tex (LaTex) - Structure any mathematical content.

Q. What is a tag?
-> It helps to structure the document.
-> Tag is written between <>.
Example: <html>, <body>, <head>, <script>, <title>, <div>, <link>, <img>, <ul>, <li>.

-> Tag type is the word written between the angular brackets.

Opening -> <html>, <body>

Q. What is the difference between a tag and an element?
-> The content including between the opening and closing tag is called an element.

-> script
-> p
-> pre
-> br
-> h1 - h6 (h1 is the biggest and h6 is the smallest).
-> img
-> video / audio
