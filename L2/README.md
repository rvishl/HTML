-> We are currently on HTML 5.

-> Give comments.
   Q. What are comments?
   -  Used to documentation
   -  Piece of code not executed.
   -  The browser will ignore.
   -  The statements which will be ignored.
   -  It is for understanding of humans.
   -  Machines will not parse (render, execute) this.
   -  Descript the code for better understanding.
   -  It is piece of text written in code which will not be parsed(rended) by the machine. It is for better understanding of the engineers (humans basically)!

Difference between href and src:
- src is used to show like may be import something kind of thing, like you are patching something using a source,
- href is most like you are navigating something we can say like that
- And we are not inter-changable (Some attribute required href and some attribute required src). So, we can not use href instead of src and visa versa.

- (src): When you want to source or when you want to attach something (for example: image, video, audio, script or any thing then we use src attribute).

- (href): when we want to navigate or when we want go somewhere then we use href

so, src tells us source of resource (where is the source located), href give us reference to Hyperlink and they are not inter-changable

Q. What is a table?
   - Tablular representation of data.
   - Combination of rows and columns.
   - Used to show structured data.


-> Some more tags:
   - anchor tag. - <a> </a> - Used to navigate between different pages on the internet.

   - div tag. <div></div> - Used to divide the whole page and keep elements in a boxed container. (if we shift the box, then the elements inside will also be shifted.)
   - Layout Tags (header, footer, aside, nav, section).
         It Helps in code readability. Instead of using div as a container. For main sections/parts of your webpage, use the layout tags.   

   - span. - <span></span> By default, it does not have any style of it's own. Like generic container for text.

   - button. <button></button> - Creates a button which can be clicked by the user.

   - table (td th tr). 
      <tabel></table> - Used to create a container for the whole table.
      <thead></thead> - Used to create a container for the heading of the table.
      <tbody></tbody> - Used to create a container for the body of the table.
      <tfoot></tfoot> - Used to create a container for the footer of the table.
      <tr></tr> - Used to create a new Row.
      <th></th> - Used to create a new cell which if of a heading style.
      <td></td> - Used to create a new cell which is of a typical paragraph style.

      colspan - Used to merge to Columns.
      rowspan - Used to merge to Rows.

   - list
   - forms/input (a little bit in depth)

   - textarea
   - bold / strong
   - Italic 
   - underline
   - sub / sup

-> Little bit of css. (color, margin).
