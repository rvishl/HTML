Q. What is CSS?
-> Cascading style sheet.
-> Using CSS, we can style HTML document.
-> Changes the look and feel.
-> We can style (improve looks) of the website.
-> CSS is used to give style to the HTML document.

We use it to make it look good.

Q. Webpage v/s Website.
-> Website is a collection of webpages.(Interlinked with each other).

Q. what is a body tag?
-> It is the element which contains the content to be displayed on the browser.

Q. what is an HTML Attribute?
-> Adds extra information to the element.
-> Attributes are associated with element.
-> They are written in the opening tag.
-> It looks like attribute_name = "attribute_value" 
-> The sequence of HTML Attributes does not matter.

-> We should not have same attributes more than once in a single tag. If we have it for any reason, then the first one will be taken into consideration and then next same attribute will be ignored!

<!DOCTYPE html> -> We use explicitly this to tell the browser that the document is an HTML document.

<title></title> -> Used to give title to the page. The text which is shown above the address bar.

<head></head> -> Used to contain the content which is not rendered in the viewport.

style -> Attribute (HTML Attribute)

CSS Style has higher priority than if same style is given using HTML attribute. (Example, text-align).

In CSS, if the same property is written more than once, then whatever is written at last will override all values written before it. (1 of the rules of specificity).
